## How It Works

### How Nest-Combo Works with NestJS CLI

If you have the **NestJS CLI** installed globally, **nest-combo** will automatically detect and use it to execute commands. This ensures compatibility with your existing global setup.

If the NestJS CLI is not installed globally, don't worry! **nest-combo** comes bundled with its own local version of the NestJS CLI. It will seamlessly fall back to this cached version to ensure smooth operation without requiring any additional setup from you.

### Key Features of Nest-Combo

#### 1. **Importing a YAML File for Project Scaffolding**

With **nest-combo**, you can define an entire project structure in a `project.yml` file and let **nest-combo** handle the scaffolding process for you. Simply specify your modules, resources, dependencies, and optional flags in the YAML file, and **nest-combo** will generate the entire project automatically.

This feature encourages thoughtful planning and allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort. Additionally, **nest-combo** supports **recursive logic** for creating nested modules, ensuring that even complex project structures are generated accurately.

For example, you can define deeply nested modules like this:

```yaml
modules:
  - name: core
    resources:
      - module
    modules:
      - name: user
        resources:
          - module
          - controller
          - service
        options:
          - --no-spec
        modules:
          - name: subUsers
            resources:
              - module
              - controller
              - service
            options:
              - --no-spec
```

This recursive approach ensures that all parent and child modules are created with proper imports and dependencies.

---

## Features

- Load a full project from a YAML file.
- Generate NestJS modules, controllers, services, gateways, middleware, and interceptors with a single-line command.
- Support for optional flags like `--no-spec` and `--dry-run`.
- Colorful and user-friendly output using `chalk`.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

---

## Installation

Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g nest-combo
```

Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
nest-combo --version
```

---

## Usage

Run the CLI tool with the desired module name and options:

```bash
nest-combo <module-name> [options]
```

### Example Commands

#### Create a Module, Controller, and Service in a Single Line

```bash
nest-combo users -m -c -s
```

#### Create a Full Project from a YAML File

```bash
nest-combo -f project.yml
```
