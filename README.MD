## How It Works

### How Nest-Combo Works with NestJS CLI

If you have the **NestJS CLI** installed globally, **nest-combo** will automatically detect and use it to execute commands. This ensures compatibility with your existing global setup.

If the NestJS CLI is not installed globally, don't worry! **nest-combo** comes bundled with its own local version of the NestJS CLI. It will seamlessly fall back to this cached version to ensure smooth operation without requiring any additional setup from you.

---

## Features

- Load a full project from a YAML file.
- Create a new project and automatically open VsCode
- Generate NestJS modules, controllers, services, gateways, middleware, and interceptors with a single-line command.
- Support for optional flags like `--no-spec` and `--dry-run`.
- Colorful and user-friendly output using `chalk`.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

---

## Installation

Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g nest-combo
```

Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
nest-combo --version
```

---

## Usage

Run the CLI tool with the desired module name and options:

```bash
nest-combo <<project|module>-name> [options]
```

### Example Commands

#### Create a project

```bash
nest-combo my-amazing-project -new # "VSCode will open by default once it's done. If you don't want it just add -no-vscode"
```

#### Create a Module, Controller, Service, Intercepetor, Gateway and Middleware in a Single Line Command

```bash
nest-combo users -m -c -s -itc -g -mw # if you don't want spcec files, just add -ns or --no-spec
```

#### Create a Full Project from a YAML File

```bash
nest-combo -f project.yml
```
